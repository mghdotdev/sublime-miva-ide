# Miva IDE!

---

### Changlog for v3.2.0:

* Added Merchant function autocompletion when requesting completions within an MvDO tag.
	* Special file bracket-dot syntax (`[ g.FILE ].Function()`) coming soonâ„¢.

* After completing a function within the `VALUE` attribute it will auto-fill the matching file into the `FILE` attribute.
	* NOTE: Must have the `FILE` attribute already created on the tag for the auto-fill to work. Use the `mvdo` snippet for the best experience.

* Added indentation rules to fix issues with non-closing MivaScript tags.
